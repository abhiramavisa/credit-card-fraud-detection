# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activities
using data analytics and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Dataset
- Transactions: 280,000+
- Target variable: Class (0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud)

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- Logistic Regression
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

## Key Insights
- Dataset is highly imbalanced
- Accuracy alone is misleading
- Recall is a critical metric for fraud detection

## Results
- Accuracy: ~99.9%
- Fraud Recall: ~64%
- Fraud Precision: ~86%

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle (Credit Card Fraud Dataset)
2. Place `creditcard.csv` in the project directory
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells
